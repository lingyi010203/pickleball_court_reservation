# PDF Export Feature Installation

To enable the frontend preview to PDF export functionality, you need to install the following packages:

## Required Packages

```bash
npm install html2canvas jspdf
```

## What this enables:

1. **Export Preview to PDF**: Users can now export the beautiful frontend preview directly to PDF
2. **High Quality Export**: The exported PDF maintains the same visual quality as the preview
3. **Better Charts**: Charts in the exported PDF will look exactly like the frontend preview
4. **No Backend Dependency**: This export works entirely on the frontend, no server processing needed

## How it works:

1. User clicks "Preview Report" to see the beautiful frontend preview
2. User clicks "Export Preview" button to download the preview as PDF
3. The system captures the preview content using html2canvas
4. Converts it to PDF using jsPDF
5. Downloads the file automatically

## Benefits over backend PDF generation:

- ✅ Beautiful charts (same as frontend)
- ✅ Perfect formatting
- ✅ No data conversion issues
- ✅ Faster generation
- ✅ No server load
- ✅ Consistent styling

## Usage:

1. Configure your report settings
2. Click "Preview Report" 
3. Review the beautiful preview
4. Click "Export Preview" to download PDF
5. The PDF will contain exactly what you see in the preview

This provides a much better user experience compared to the backend-generated PDFs which have formatting and chart quality issues.
